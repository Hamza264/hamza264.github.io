# About me

I’m a coder who’s obsessed with all things tech, video-making, and staying healthy.

I was born and raised in Vienna, Austria, but my roots trace back to Chechnya, where my parents immigrated from.

My first job was at Shadowmap, where I edited videos and handled customer emails. It taught me a ton about juggling different tasks, communicating clearly, and keeping things running smoothly. Alongside my work, I’ve developed a passion for coding and networking, and I’m always looking for ways to combine these with my interests in video production and healthy living.

When I’m not in front of a computer, you’ll probably find me working out, or networking with people who share the same passions. Always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on innovative projects.
